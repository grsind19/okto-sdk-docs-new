## App ID

The App ID is a unique identifier for your application and you as a [Vendor](/docs/introduction-to-okto/okto-vendor-user). It's used to associate your Okto client with this specific app in our system. Include this ID when initializing your Okto client in your application.

### Steps to Access App ID

1. [Log in](https://dashboard.okto.tech/login) to the Okto Dashboard.

2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section from the sidebar menu.

## App Secret

The App Secret is a confidential key used to authenticate your API requests. Keep this secret secure and never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.

### Steps to Access App Secret

1. [Log in](https://dashboard.okto.tech/login) to the Okto Dashboard.

2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section from the sidebar menu.

3. Click the **Get App Secret** button. You may be prompted to re-authenticate.

4. Once revealed, copy and securely store the App Secret.

<Callout title="Note">
- App ID and App Secret pairs are unique for each environment (e.g., sandbox, production).  
- Ensure you're using the correct pair for the environment you're working in.  
- Okto does not store your API secret so keep it safe and secret.

## Storing App Secret

* **How Okto stores it**: Okto does not store any vendors’ API secret. In case it's lost, you can reset the key.  
* **How you should store it**:  
  * Use environment variables or secure secret management systems.  
  * Never hardcode the secret in your application code.  
  * Avoid storing it in version control systems.

## Reset App Secret

If you lose your App Secret or suspect unauthorized use:

1. Go to the **API Keys** section on the dashboard.

![API Secret - Okto Dashboard](/images/app-secret-dashboard.png)

2. Click the **Reset** button next to the App Secret field.

3. A new **App Secret** will be generated. Copy the App Secret and store it securely.

4. Update all your applications with the new secret to avoid service disruption.

<Callout title="Note">
  - If someone obtains your App ID and App Secret, they could potentially make unauthorized requests on behalf of your application.  
  - In case of a suspected breach, immediately regenerate your App Secret and update your applications.

## FAQ

**1. What is the difference between App ID and App Secret for Vendors?**

- App ID: A public identifier for your application used to associate your client with Okto.

- App Secret: A private key used to authenticate requests from your application to Okto's servers. It is also referred to as OKTO API KEY in the docs.

**2. How do I know which environment (sandbox/production) my API keys belong to?**

Each environment’s keys are managed separately. Ensure the environment is indicated in your dashboard (e.g., "Sandbox" or "Production") before copying your keys.

**3. What should I do if I accidentally expose my App Secret?**

Immediately reset your App Secret through the dashboard and update it in your applications to prevent unauthorized access.
